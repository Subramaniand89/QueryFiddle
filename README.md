# QueryFiddle
A simplified query fiddle in builder style


Description
An SQL fiddle, which will follow a close pattern similar to builder pattern. This is the proposed idea behind the fiddle. We already have SQL fiddle, which implements a normal querying structure. Our aim is to simplify that and query in a simpler manner.
